# COVID-19 Vaccine Data Visualization

In order to run our project and reproduce our results, you would need to open two of our files:
* final_project_processing_163.py
* final_project_plotting.py

Final Project Processing contains code for processing all the relevant data needed for our analysis.
Final Project Plotting contains code to complete the actual plotting of graphs as well as maps.

## Necessary Packages
Your device should have Pandas, GeoPandas, Altair, as well as Matplotlib available in order for the code to run properly.

## Data
You will not need to download a new dataset as we retrieve this dataset from an online platform, which is updated on a daily basis.
